## üëâ Vision

The aim of [page-speed.dev](https://page-speed.dev) is to make it easy and straightforward to share web performance results. Currently, PageSpeed Insights and Core Web Vitals results are difficult to share, and and often shared via screenshot rather than via a link back to the source.

So:

* Results are **cached for a day plus next request** making subsequent requests fast and easy to share.
* **Mobile results** are displayed. (Desktop results are too easy to get good results for and don't adequately reflect a site's performance.)
* **Core Web Vitals are prioritised** where available as these are a better measure of performance than Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights results.
* **Metrics in OpenGraph images** to provide an easy way to share data.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] UI improvements and further optimisations
- [ ] explain (and link out to resources on) the meaning of core web vitals acronyms (LCP, CLS, INP)
- [ ] compute single web vitals score or make it easier to see what vital 'failed' the site
